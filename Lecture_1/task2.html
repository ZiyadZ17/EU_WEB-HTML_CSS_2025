        <h3>Georgia</h3>

    <p>
        Georgia[c] is a country in the Caucasus region on the coast of the Black Sea. It is located at the intersection of Eastern Europe and West Asia,[14][15] and is today generally regarded as part of Europe.[16] It is bordered to the north and northeast by Russia, to the south by Turkey and Armenia, and to the southeast by Azerbaijan. Georgia covers an area of 69,700 square kilometres (26,900 sq mi).[17] It has a population of 3.9 million,[d][10] of which over a third live in the capital and largest city, Tbilisi. Ethnic Georgians, who are native to the region, constitute a majority of the country's population and are its titular nation.
